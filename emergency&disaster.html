  <h2>Be a Helping Hand</h2>
  <p>Your support can save lives during emergencies.</p>
<p>
          During natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes, and cyclones, our charity provides 
          immediate relief through food distribution, medical aid, temporary shelter, and clean water supply.  
          We coordinate with local volunteers and organizations to ensure fast response and maximum impact.

        <h3>Rehabilitation Support</h3>
        <p>
          Beyond immediate relief, we help affected families rebuild their lives by offering 
          rehabilitation programs, construction of safe housing, distribution of essential goods, 
          and long-term psychological support for trauma recovery.

        <h3>Community Preparedness</h3>
        <p>
          We also work on educating communities about disaster preparedness. 
          By conducting awareness workshops, safety drills, and first-aid training, 
          we ensure that people are better equipped to handle emergencies in the future.
