    We organize free health check-ups, vaccination drives, awareness programs, 
    and provide medical help in collaboration with doctors and hospitals.
    Health & medical services by charities ensure that the poor, marginalized, and rural communities get the care they need. 
    These initiatives save lives, improve well-being, and build a healthier, stronger society.
